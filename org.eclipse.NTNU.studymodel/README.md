# TDT4250 - Assignment 1

## Structure

The Ecore model itself can be found in model/ProgrammeNext.ecore.
I have also included some sample data in Department.xmi. This data is supposed to represent the master programme Informatics and two of
its specializations, Software and Artificial Intelligence.

As for the custom code, all of it can currently be found in src/programme/util/ProgrammeValidator. The following methods contain custom code:

validateStudyYear_mustCOntainFallAndSpringSemesters

helper_validateSemester_semesterTypesMustMatch

validateSemester_semesterTypesMustMatch
